# NTree
A generic custom N-ary tree in Java.

## Quick start
For now, `NTree` is only available via building from source.
You'll need [maven][maven] installed in your system to build `NTree`.

After you've ensured you have installed maven, simply do:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:VHarisop/NTree.git
cd NTree/ && mvn clean install
```

## Including NTree in your Maven Project
You can either take a look at the `pom.xml` file to figure out parameters
like `groupId`, `version` etc. or:

```xml
<groupId>gr.demokritos.ntree</groupId>
<artifactId>NTree</artifactId>
<version>[latest version here]</version>
```
